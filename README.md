Sample representing Saooti SDK: https://github.com/saooti/android-sdk-ui

## Setup

You need to have access to:
- UI SDK repo https://github.com/saooti/android-sdk-ui
- Core SDK repo https://github.com/saooti/android-sdk-core

Once you have permissions - generate a new classic token https://github.com/settings/tokens with `read:packages` permission for your account.

Set your credentials (GiHub username and generated token) to `settings.gradle`.

Set your organisation id to `MainActivity.kt` at `Saooti.setOrganisationId("<organisation_id>")`.
